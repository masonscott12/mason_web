<p> I like sleeping because it helps me think of what I have to do when I want to think.
plus sleeping is not bad its just sleeping too much is kind of bad.I wake up pretty early so i can sleeping better at night 
because I cant sleep. 

I enjoy playing videogames when I can,helps me keep a calm head when stressed out with school work.
I try not to play to too long
