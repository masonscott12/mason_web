<p> "Hello!
<p> what I learn today was how to make my own web page for the first time.Its a new concept that im not used to but im gonna have to get used to it.
Its fascinating how all this works together to make a web page.
</p>
<p> State the purpose of having varying sizes for heading.</p>
I think the purpose of varying heading sizes is because you might want to see which font is the largest

<!-- next tag will be used to create a list -->
<p> there are two kinds of list</p>

<p> I like sleeping because it helps me think of what I have to do when I want to think.
plus sleeping is not bad its just sleeping too much is kind of bad.I wake up pretty early so i can sleeping better at night 
because I cant sleep. 

I enjoy playing videogames when I can,helps me keep a calm head when stressed out with school work.
I try not to play to too long
